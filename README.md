A small crawler for news websites

### Getting started

First clone or fork the [repo](https://github.com/olivif/stories-crawler.git). 

#### Running locally
You will need to have mongodb installed locally and running before you run `stories-crawler`.  
 
Install dependencies with `npm install` and then run with `gulp`. This will start the api on `localhost:8000`. You can verify it's running by going to `https://localhost:8000/api`.  

#### Testing 
All the tests are in the root folder under `test` and you can run them using `npm test`, which uses mocha under the hood.
